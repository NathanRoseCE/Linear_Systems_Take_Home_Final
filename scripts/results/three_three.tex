The non-linear system was implimented with the following code
\TODO{add code fragment}
A sample with starting inputs of: $\begin{bmatrix}
-1.5\\
0.0\\
1.0\\
3.0\\
\end{bmatrix}
$ produces the followung outputs

For the limit, the system was considered stabalized if after 10 seconds the system state variable $\theta$ was within $\pm0.01$ and the result of this is a theta limit of: 4.0
